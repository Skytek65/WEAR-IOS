This version is the latest version of the original developers( V 0.31), with a few tweaks and motifications 
to make it a little easier to use. Some of the things include automaticly going back to the home screen after 
a sucessful conection is made that way you dont accadently close it, also for gmail and the stock messages app 
I have implemented the background images that you would see with an android device notification. I'll try to get 
screenshots in here eventaully but if you are having trouble setting it up, then please look at the original developers
